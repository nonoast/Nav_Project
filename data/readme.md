We need to :- Clean the wifi csv file(matrix) to avoid NaN and normalize it (/90dB) and compare CNN method
            - Complete the step method to get a working example and compare it with reality
            - Continue to work on the INS to make the gyroscope detecting in the path working
            - Mix everything in maybe a kalman filter and also CNN model so see diffference and if it's relevant
